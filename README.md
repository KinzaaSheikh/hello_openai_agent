# Chatbot
This is a basic Chatbot that was inspired by BookTube's trend of recommending hyper specific book recommendations. It uses OpenAI's new Agent SDK and also Gemini 2.0 Flash. 

Anyone can fork the code and come up with their own ideas to build Agents that can be used in a variety of use cases.

Best thing about OpenAI's new SDK is its simplicity and ease of use. It's a great way to get started with Agents and also to learn more about the capabilities of the new SDK.
